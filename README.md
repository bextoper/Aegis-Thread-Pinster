# Aegis-Thread-Pinster

A simple Discord bot to add and remove pins in threads. Created to avoid the need to grant permissions to users directly, by instead relying on a bot checking the owner of the thread and setting them up for them.
An instruction on how to use is automatically sent on thread creation, with an option to delete the message.


- !pinhelp - Shows info on how to use the bot.

Requirements:
- discord.py
- python-dotenv
